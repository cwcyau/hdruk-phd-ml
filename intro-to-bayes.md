# Bayesian Analysis

**Professor Christopher Yau, University of Manchester**

The purpose of this lecture is to provide an overview of the key steps of classical Bayesian analysis. We will then consider how Bayesian principles are applied in the current era and the implications of convergences in Statistics and Computation that have seen the emergence of a new Bayesian paradigm.

Topics covered include:
  - Principles of Bayesian analysis
  - De Finetti's Theorem
  - Decision Theory
  - Computational Statistics

Pre-requisites:

If you have no previous experience of Bayesian Statistics (or need a refresher) then follow this excellent video series by [Ben Lambert](https://ben-lambert.com/about/) on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFDbGp5YzjqXQ4oE4w9GVWdiokWB9gEpm).
