# Modelling in Machine Learning

**Professor Christopher Yau, University of Manchester**

In this lecture, we will consider the principles of modelling in a machine learning settings. We will consider a number of case studies and focus on the modelling choices that went into the design of the machine learning methods.

Topics covered include:
  - Design of probabilistic models
  - Choosing inference techniques
  - Model checking and validation
