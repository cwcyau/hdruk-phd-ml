# HDRUK-Turing PhD Programme in Health Data Science: Machine Learning 

This is a repo for the Machine Learning training series for the Year 1 Cohort of the HDRUK-Turing PhD Programme in Health Data Science.

## Overview

The purpose of this course is to provide students with an overview of the cutting edge ideas in modern machine learning with a focus on probabilistic approaches based on Bayesian methodology. We hope to enable further exploration of these topics as relevant to student's long-term research plans.
