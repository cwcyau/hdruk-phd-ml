# HDRUK-Turing PhD Programme in Health Data Science: Machine Learning 

This is a repo for the Machine Learning training series for the Year 1 Cohort of the HDRUK-Turing PhD Programme in Health Data Science.

The purpose of this course is to provide students with an overview of the cutting edge ideas in modern machine learning with a focus on probabilistic approaches based on Bayesian methodology. We hope to enable further exploration of these topics as relevant to student's long-term research plans.

## Programme Contents

**1. [Introduction to Bayesian Machine Learning](intro-to-bayes.md)**

The purpose of this lecture is to provide an overview of the key steps of classical Bayesian analysis. We will then consider how Bayesian principles are applied in the current era and the implications of convergences in Statistics and Computation that have seen the emergence of a new Bayesian paradigm.

Topics covered include:
  - Principles of Bayesian analysis
  - De Finetti's Theorem
  - Decision Theory
  - Computational Statistics
