# Approximate Inference

**Dr Kaspar MÃ¤rtens, The Alan Turing Institute**

Approximate inference techniques are vital to the production of scalable algorithms that can operate on large high-dimensional data sets. This lecture will discuss two frequently used inference methods in Bayesian machine learning: variational inference and stochastic gradient descent with case studies.

Topics covered include:
  - Variational inference
  - Stochastic gradient descent
